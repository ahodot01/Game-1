### Game / Win Or Bust / Multiple Scenarios / Variables Manipulation
Used Python to write a Win Or Bust game. Rules: There are 2 teams: A and B. Each team has 3 players. Each 
player has one attempt to enter a number, three per team, six altogether. Number must be between 1 and 200. 
Winner allocation: All entered numbers from each team members will be added up. Team with higher number 
wins, but sum must be lower than 238. Otherwise team, which exceeded this number will go BUST. Prize 
distribution: Prize paid in GBP. Prize will equal winning number amount. But if other team went BUST, 
then prize will be made via also adding losing team score to the prize.
